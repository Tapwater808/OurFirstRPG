### Description of Project

- Using ReactJs as the framework, this is a simple Role-Playing-Game to demonstrate the capabilities of the technology in the hands of capable developers. After
initial sign up and log in, the player has an initial quest that begins with the players partner requesting that they make them a sandwhich. Simple, right? The player 
will be able to freeky move between four main maps at this stage but down the line will have the simple request of a sandwhich turn into a branching story. Down the road, 
the player will be able to access an inventory system as well as a save mechanic, using Mongodb as the technology which will allow the player to save their progress and 
return at a later time.
